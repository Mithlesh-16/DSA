// The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle.

// You are given three pegs (often called Source, Auxiliary, Destination).

// You also have n disks of different sizes stacked on one peg (the source), in increasing order of size from top to bottom (smallest on top, largest at bottom).

// The goal is to move the entire stack from the source peg to the destination peg.

// The puzzle comes with two strict rules:

// You can move only one disk at a time.

// You can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.

// So, the Tower of Hanoi question is:

// “Given n disks on one peg, how can you transfer the entire stack to another peg, following the rules above, using the third peg as an auxiliary?”
